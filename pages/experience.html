        <h2>Safety Steward</h2>
        <h3>Tottenham Hotspurs Football Club</h3>
        <p>
          Being a steward for Tottenham Hotspurs Football Club since December 2022 has made me aware of prerequisite skills such as being punctual, reliable, honest and socialising with people from a wide range of ages. It taught me to be proactive when engaging with customers and to try to fulfil customer satisfaction as much as I can.

          An example of overcoming a difficulty was during Beyonce's concert on <strong>June 2023</strong>. There was a drunk fan that started to cause some problems within the stands such as talking in a mean and unpleasant demeanor other fans. My supervisor and I had been tasked to diffuse the situation. Whilst my supervisor was comforting fans that recieved the abuse, I had taken the culprit out of the situation to speak to him one on one. This choice allowed me to communicate calmly to him away from other fans to try connect with him on a personal level to diffuse the situation. This prevention allowed the de-escalated and in the end agreed the fan can carry on watching the show but in a different section.

          I was lucky enough to volunteer to teach year 6 primary children on how to build a tiny computer (KANO). I taught them step by step by following a manual. This taught me how to communicate with a younger audience to engage them and cultivate their attention without being boring. Additionally, it made me realise the importance of being punctual in order to prepare beforehand so that there is a clear and chronological order with the sequences of events when teaching them.

          There was a hackathon for the company DOJO. Our goal was to come up with a piece of technology that could help benefit the education sector. My group and I came up with the idea of making a VR headset that could emulate PE (Physical Education) at Secondary schools without the need of equipment. As elected leader, clear communication was crucial to coordinate the team effectively. I figured out the strengths and weaknesses of each member and delegated each task accordingly. It provided greater knowledge about teamwork and enhanced my communication skills.

          I attended an event at DOJO where my team and I had to create a shopping website with a functioning shopping cart experience. This introduced me into HTML, CSS and JavaScript and from that point onwards I went on to create many projects using those programing languages
